# AI Masters Project

The following notebooks were completed as part of my MSc in Software Design with Artificial Intelligence. They explore data analysis and machine learning using real-world datasets.

- [`diabetes_prediction_decision_tree.ipynb`](diabetes_prediction_decision_tree.ipynb): Uses a decision tree classifier to predict diabetes outcomes based on clinical features.

- [`mental_health_prediction-dataset.ipynb`](mental_health_prediction-dataset.ipynb): Applies a BERT transformer model to detect mental health issues in social media posts.
